description: This week, we met five more interviewees and focused on three specific dimensions of traveling-- alone and in groups, for work and for pleasure, and pre- versus during travel. We dug deep and posed dozens of questions that hoped to answer how we might improve their experiences. We then narrowed our questions down to a few problems, came up with a few dozen solutions, and tested three of them in the field.
